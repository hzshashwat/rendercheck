RenderCheck - ML-Powered WebApp Coding Portal
RenderCheck is an advanced and secure web application designed to provide a unique and competitive coding experience. This portal enables participants to replicate provided UIs using code, which is then rendered and evaluated in real-time using Machine Learning algorithms to determine accuracy. This evaluation process offers precise feedback, helping participants gauge their performance and refine their coding skills.

🎯 Project Overview
RenderCheck has been extensively used in multiple events and coding competitions, delivering a seamless and secure experience to all participants. With its powerful evaluation algorithms and machine learning integration, RenderCheck has achieved remarkable accuracy in assessing UI coding challenges.

The platform includes real-time tracking of participants' accuracy and progress. It features a dynamic and competitive leaderboard that provides up-to-the-minute insights into all teams’ rankings. This combination of real-time evaluation and a competitive leaderboard enhances the overall experience and promotes a spirit of healthy competition among participants.

🚀 Key Features
Real-Time Accuracy Assessment: Utilizing advanced TensorFlow-based ML models, the system evaluates how closely participants’ code matches the given UI and calculates an accuracy percentage.
Dynamic Competitive Leaderboard: A responsive leaderboard to visualize all teams’ progress and their real-time standings in the competition.
Extensive Usage in Competitions: Successfully hosted numerous coding events with proven track records in accuracy, scalability, and participant engagement.
Secure Architecture: Developed by a skilled professional with expertise in Django development and cybersecurity (ISC2-certified). Every part of the system is designed to ensure data integrity, user privacy, and robust access controls.
